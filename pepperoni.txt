Pepperoni, also known as pepperoni sausage, is an American variety of salami, usually made from cured pork and beef mixed together.

Pepperoni is characteristically soft, slightly smoky, and bright red in colour. Thinly sliced pepperoni is a popular pizza topping in American-style pizzerias and is used as a filling in the West Virginia pepperoni roll. It is also used to make some varieties of submarine sandwiches.
